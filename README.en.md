## ✨ What it does

- **Tap once, it learns** — tap the bot's check-in button once and it replays daily, automatically. It keeps up even when the button's callback data changes.
- **Text commands too** — set a bot ID plus a command (e.g. `/checkin`) and it sends on schedule.
- **Group & channel check-ins** — group IDs are supported; replies are read from group messages.
- **Your schedule** — signing window · per-target random slots · minimum spacing · make-up deadline (23:00 by default) · pause a target for a week.
- **Rate-limit friendly** — on failure it backs off 5m → 15m → 45m → 2h → 4h, waits out `FLOOD_WAIT` exactly as the server asks, and catches up when the network returns.
- **Block what you don't want** — keyword / regex rules (matched against bot replies and button labels) · block a whole bot · freeze a single target. Network-learned hits wait for your confirmation.
- **Multi-account, fully isolated** — targets and signed-state are kept per account; targets can be copied across accounts.
- **Daily summary** — one message a day to your own Saved Messages (no system notifications); an extra alert after 3 consecutive failing days.
- **Cross-client sync** — the official client and third-party clients share targets and signed state.
- **Bilingual UI** — English out of the box on English devices; switchable in Settings.
- **100% local** — no server, no telemetry, nothing reported.

## 🖥️ Supported clients

The module matches by host package first, then falls back to flag-class capability — it only injects on a match.

| Client | Package | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram (Play / default) | `org.telegram.messenger` | ✅ tested on 12.10.4 |
| Telegram (direct APK) | `org.telegram.messenger.web` | ✅ statically verified |
| Nagram (NextAlone) | `xyz.nextalone.nagram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3 |
| Nagram XF | `fork.risin42.nagramx` | ✅ tested (dec46b0) |
| ExteraLess (ExteraGram fork) | `com.exteraless.app` | ✅ tested on 12.10.1 |
| Nekogram | `tw.nekomimi.nekogram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3 |
| Mercurygram | `it.belloworld.mercurygram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3.1 |
| Nagram / NagramX / NagramNX | `nu.gpu.nagram` etc. | whitelisted, not tested |
| Other Telegram-Android forks | any | injects if flag classes are intact |
| Telegram X | — | ❌ not injected (different core) |

Adapted for the whole Telegram **12.10.x** line, including 12.10.4.

> ⚠️ **Scope**: LSPosed only enables the official client by default. If you use a third-party client, tick **that client** in the module's scope as well.

---

## 🚀 30-second setup

1. Install the APK → **LSPosed** → **Modules** → enable **TGAutoSign**
2. Tick your Telegram client under **Scope**
3. Fully stop Telegram, then reopen it
4. Send `/jmb` in any chat → go to the bot chat and **tap its check-in button once**

> Done — it signs daily from then on. Send `/jmb` anytime to check status or change settings.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Tapped the button but nothing was added**

Check the auto-learn switch under Settings → Learning, or add the target manually via `/jmb` → Add target. If it still won't add, make sure the scope is ticked and fully restart Telegram.

**The bot uses buttons instead of text — does that work?**

Yes. Tapping once teaches it (the list shows a type badge) and it replays daily. Buttons that merely open a web page or a game (no callback data) are never mis-learned.

**It works on the official client but not my third-party one**

Those clients are supported (see the matrix above), but scope only includes the official client by default. Tick your client in LSPosed, then fully restart Telegram.

**Signing isn't working — what do I do?**

Run `/jmb` → **Self-check** to verify the reflection anchors, then check the built-in log view for injection and signing records. Still stuck? Export the log together with your client name and version, and open an issue.

**How do I migrate to a new phone or account?**

On the old device: `/jmb` → **Export**. On the new one, drop the json into `Android/data/<client package>/files/tgautosign/` and import it. Import merges — it never wipes.

**Update says "signature mismatch"**

You installed a debug build. Uninstall it, then install the official APK from this page. Official builds upgrade over each other in place, and your data is kept.

## 📜 更新日志 · Changelog

### v1.6.0 (123) — 2026-09-26

**Architecture**: Account isolation moved from convention to structure. · Six single-responsibility classes extracted from the core file. · Pure logic is now unit-testable. · Storage keys consolidated into a single source of truth. · Flush policy made explicit.

**Fixed**: Account crossover — all six paths now pin the account. · Out-of-range guard read another account's partition (important). · Failed targets were signed over and over (important). · Duplicate scheduling within one account (important). · A successful check-in was revoked and shown as "backoff" (important). · Panel waiting always timed out into the fallback (important). · Same class of bug, full sweep: three more places treated success as failure. · The "pending" pool is now per-account, with automatic migration. · The state used to be write-only: once set there was no way to clear it apart from a manual test… · Reply verdict could land on the wrong account (important). · A full-account round reported one account's tally as another's. · Clearing config left state behind, resurrecting it on re-add (important). · Clearing config wrongly deleted the per-account pending pool. · Stale buttons caused an endless retry loop. · Silent robots made the module wait out a timeout every day. · Crash when saving in the settings screen. · Opening "Logs" stuttered. · Only the first startup line reached the log file. · Tapping a bot button within 30 s of a cold start did nothing. · The make-up window became all day when it crossed midnight. · Configs synced from another client did not apply locally. · Only the first of several bot buttons was learned. · Chain ids in the log could repeat across accounts. · Two instances ran in parallel after a hot reload. · Numeric headings rendered as wrong glyphs in the startup log. · Decorative text showed tofu boxes. · The "pending" retry button used the wrong account.

**New**: Detailed version info in logs and the diagnostics bundle. · Host friendly names follow the UI language.

**Tooling**: The in-repo build.sh was missing three gates. · Unit assertions grew from 115 to 174. · The wiring checker listed a method that no longer existed.

### v1.5.8 (121) — 2026-09-24

**Fixed**: Panels turned light — fixed · Theme logging now records every change · "Unrecognized bot reply" is no longer an error · A single tap is no longer processed multiple times · i18n gate covers the whitelist gap; 18 missing translations fixed · The gate now catches "helper used, dictionary forgotten" · Heartbeat slows down when there is nothing to do · Scheduled tasks no longer pile up or get lost · Panel-refresh trigger no longer double-sends with the heartbeat · Bot names stuck as numeric IDs after the first attempt · Common "already signed today" phrasings are recognised now · "Not a check-in result" no longer reads like a failure · Auto-detection being off is no longer silent · New installs couldn't learn from button taps (important) · Capture mode did nothing on Nagram \/ official · Deny reason was misreported · Wrong account number shown (e.g. "account 10") · Stale account prefix in logs · Windows that cross midnight actually work now · Cross-client sync no longer mixes up accounts · Applying a synced config replans the timer · Pending window now matches the failure-undo window · Cross-client sync is throttled · Build checks the debug patch tag

**New**: Verdict words became switches · New "loose mode" switch

**Reliability**: Pure-logic unit tests, wired into the build gate · Unrecognized bot replies are no longer silent · Exceptions on critical paths are no longer swallowed

**Diagnostics**: Diagnostics now reports learning and hook state · Patch tag shown in the diagnostics header · Diagnostics now shows the raw account field
