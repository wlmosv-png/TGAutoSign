**Tap once. Signed every day.**

Tap the bot's check-in button in Telegram once — then never think about it again.
The control panel lives inside Telegram: send `/jmb` in any chat.

## ✨ What it does

- **Tap once, it learns** — tap the bot's check-in button once and it replays daily, automatically. It keeps up even when the button's callback data changes.
- **Text commands too** — set a bot ID plus a command (e.g. `/checkin`) and it sends on schedule.
- **Group & channel check-ins** — group IDs are supported; replies are read from group messages.
- **Your schedule** — signing window · per-target random slots · minimum spacing · make-up deadline (23:00 by default) · pause a target for a week.
- **Rate-limit friendly** — on failure it backs off 5m → 15m → 45m → 2h → 4h, waits out `FLOOD_WAIT` exactly as the server asks, and catches up when the network returns.
- **Block what you don't want** — keyword / regex rules (matched against bot replies and button labels) · block a whole bot · freeze a single target. Network-learned hits wait for your confirmation.
- **Multi-account, fully isolated** — targets and signed-state are kept per account; targets can be copied across accounts.
- **Daily summary** — one message a day to your own Saved Messages (no system notifications); an extra alert after 3 consecutive failing days.
- **Cross-client sync** — the official client and third-party clients share targets and signed state.
- **Bilingual UI** — English out of the box on English devices; switchable in Settings.
- **100% local** — no server, no telemetry, nothing reported.

## 🖥️ Supported clients

The module matches by host package first, then falls back to flag-class capability — it only injects on a match.

| Client | Package | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram (Play / default) | `org.telegram.messenger` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3 |
| Telegram (direct APK) | `org.telegram.messenger.web` | ✅ statically verified |
| Nagram XF | `fork.risin42.nagramx` | ✅ tested (dec46b0) |
| ExteraLess (ExteraGram fork) | `com.exteraless.app` | ✅ tested on 12.10.1 |
| Nagram / NagramX / NagramNX | `nu.gpu.nagram` etc. | whitelisted, not tested |
| Other Telegram-Android forks | any | injects if flag classes are intact |
| Telegram X | — | ❌ not injected (different core) |

Adapted for the whole Telegram **12.10.x** line, including 12.10.3.

> ⚠️ **Scope**: LSPosed only enables the official client by default. If you use a third-party client, tick **that client** in the module's scope as well.

## 🚀 30-second setup

1. Install the APK → **LSPosed** → **Modules** → enable **TGAutoSign**
2. Tick your Telegram client under **Scope**
3. Fully stop Telegram, then reopen it
4. Send `/jmb` in any chat → go to the bot chat and **tap its check-in button once**

> Done — it signs daily from then on. Send `/jmb` anytime to check status or change settings.

## ❓ FAQ

**Tapped the button but nothing was added**

Check the auto-learn switch under Settings → Learning, or add the target manually via `/jmb` → Add target. If it still won't add, make sure the scope is ticked and fully restart Telegram.

**The bot uses buttons instead of text — does that work?**

Yes. Tapping once teaches it (the list shows a type badge) and it replays daily. Buttons that merely open a web page or a game (no callback data) are never mis-learned.

**It works on the official client but not my third-party one**

Those clients are supported (see the matrix above), but scope only includes the official client by default. Tick your client in LSPosed, then fully restart Telegram.

**Signing isn't working — what do I do?**

Run `/jmb` → **Self-check** to verify the reflection anchors, then check the built-in log view for injection and signing records. Still stuck? Export the log together with your client name and version, and open an issue.

**How do I migrate to a new phone or account?**

On the old device: `/jmb` → **Export**. On the new one, drop the json into `Android/data/<client package>/files/tgautosign/` and import it. Import merges — it never wipes.

**Update says "signature mismatch"**

You installed a debug build. Uninstall it, then install the official APK from this page. Official builds upgrade over each other in place, and your data is kept.

- **Per-account isolation fix** — two accounts using the same bot no longer clash; new Accounts overview
