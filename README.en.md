**Tap once. Signed every day.**

Tap the bot's check-in button in Telegram once — then never think about it again.
The control panel lives inside Telegram: send `/jmb` in any chat.

### Local by design

<sub>No account credentials, no official API, no data leaving your device.</sub>

- The **only outbound call** is an update check every 12 hours — it can be disabled, and it carries no sign-in data
- Targets and signed-state live in Telegram's local storage; they **never leave the device**
- The module requests **no** storage, notification or install permissions; all automation happens on-device, with no relay server

> ⚠️ **Risk notice** — any Telegram automation carries some risk of account restriction. This module uses client-side check-ins, randomised slots and backoff, and is deliberately gentle, but **makes no zero-risk claim**.

## What it does

- **Tap once, it learns** — tap the bot's check-in button once and it replays daily, automatically. It keeps up even when the button's callback data changes.
- **Text commands too** — set a bot ID plus a command (e.g. `/checkin`) and it sends on schedule.
- **Group & channel check-ins** — group IDs are supported; replies are read from group messages.
- **Your schedule** — signing window · per-target random slots · minimum spacing · make-up deadline (23:00 by default) · pause a target for a week.
- **Rate-limit friendly** — on failure it backs off 5m → 15m → 45m → 2h → 4h, waits out `FLOOD_WAIT` exactly as the server asks, and catches up when the network returns.
- **Block what you don't want** — keyword / regex rules (matched against bot replies and button labels) · block a whole bot · freeze a single target. Network-learned hits wait for your confirmation.
- **Multi-account, fully isolated** — targets and signed-state are kept per account; targets can be copied across accounts.
- **Daily summary** — one message a day to your own Saved Messages (no system notifications); an extra alert after 3 consecutive failing days.
- **Cross-client sync** — the official client and third-party clients share targets and signed state.
- **Bilingual UI** — English out of the box on English devices; switchable in Settings.
- **Local by design** — no server, no telemetry; the update check is the only outbound call and can be disabled.

## Supported clients

The module matches by host package first, then falls back to flag-class capability — it only injects on a match.

<sub>**Requires** root + LSPosed (libxposed **API 102** or newer — see LSPosed Manager → Settings → About). **Not supported**: non-root devices, Telegram X, standalone server deployment.</sub>

| Client | Package | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram (Play / default) | `org.telegram.messenger` | ✅ tested on 12.10.4 |
| Telegram (direct APK) | `org.telegram.messenger.web` | ✅ statically verified |
| Nagram (NextAlone) | `xyz.nextalone.nagram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3 |
| Nagram XF | `fork.risin42.nagramx` | ✅ tested (dec46b0) |
| ExteraLess (ExteraGram fork) | `com.exteraless.app` | ✅ tested on 12.10.1 |
| Nekogram | `tw.nekomimi.nekogram` | ❌ not injected (heavily R8-obfuscated) |
| Mercurygram | `it.belloworld.mercurygram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3.1 |
| Turrit | `org.telegram.group` | ✅ statically verified on 1.9.0.4.2 |
| Nagram / NagramX / NagramNX | `nu.gpu.nagram` etc. | whitelisted, not tested |
| Other Telegram-Android forks | any | injects if flag classes are intact |
| Telegram X | — | ❌ not injected (different core) |

Adapted for the whole Telegram **12.10.x** line, including 12.10.4.

> ⚠️ **Scope**: LSPosed only enables the official client by default. If you use a third-party client, tick **that client** in the module's scope as well.

---

## 30-second setup

1. Install the APK → **LSPosed** → **Modules** → enable **TGAutoSign**
2. Tick your Telegram client under **Scope**
3. Fully stop Telegram, then reopen it
4. Send `/jmb` in any chat → go to the bot chat and **tap its check-in button once**

> Done — it signs daily from then on. Send `/jmb` anytime to check status or change settings.

---

## FAQ

**Tapped the button but nothing was added**

Check the auto-learn switch under Settings → Learning, or add the target manually via `/jmb` → Add target. If it still won't add, make sure the scope is ticked and fully restart Telegram.

**The bot uses buttons instead of text — does that work?**

Yes. Tapping once teaches it (the list shows a type badge) and it replays daily. Buttons that merely open a web page or a game (no callback data) are never mis-learned.

**It works on the official client but not my third-party one**

Those clients are supported (see the matrix above), but scope only includes the official client by default. Tick your client in LSPosed, then fully restart Telegram.

**Signing isn't working — what do I do?**

Run `/jmb` → **Self-check** to verify the reflection anchors, then check the built-in log view for injection and signing records. Still stuck? Export the log together with your client name and version, and open an issue.

**How do I migrate to a new phone or account?**

On the old device: `/jmb` → **Export**. On the new one, drop the json into `Android/data/<client package>/files/tgautosign/` and import it. Import merges — it never wipes.

**Update says "signature mismatch"**

You installed a debug build. Uninstall it, then install the official APK from this page. Official builds upgrade over each other in place, and your data is kept.

## 更新日志 · Changelog

### v1.6.4 (130) — 2026-10-08

**New**: A review page that turns unrecognised bot replies into learned judge words. · Confirming "signed" now teaches the word permanently. · Dialogs now fade in and out. · Button learning now asks for confirmation (on by default). · Confirming a candidate can also remember what to do next time. · Sign-in-like buttons are learned automatically; the rest are asked about.

**Fixed**: In groups, the bot's reply could be dropped together with the whole update batch. · A bot that did reply could be reported as "no reply". · User judge words were shadowed by the built-in tables. · A single space between word and reply broke the match. · The learned word could come from an unrelated greeting. · Adverts and greetings could be learned as judge words. · One bot could exhaust the pool quota. · Target list and stats window heights were wrong. · The last row of the list was half-covered by the button bar. · Opening a page caused the dialog to visibly jump. · In groups, the bot's reply could be reported as "no reply". · Someone else's check-in in a group could be credited to you. · A group id missing the `100` prefix could never be matched. · Your own command could show up in the "unrecognised replies" list. · One entry in the pending list could keep growing. · A filtered button used to vanish with no way back. · Mentioning "check-in" while chatting in a group could be collected. · Opening the log page flickered. · The last row could be cut off in the target list and stats. · The review page stuttered on every tap. · The pending badge said 1 while several items were waiting.

### v1.6.3 (129) — 2026-10-05

**Fixed**: Button learning was broken: the type check was case-sensitive. · The in-bubble button callback class no longer exists in official Telegram. · Tapping a button could do nothing, with no log at all. · A group target was re-sent 13 times in one day. · Duplicate sends in groups; the bot's "used up today" reply was not recognised. · The missed-check-in root cause: two different data sources. · Infinite recursion froze Telegram (ANR). · The daily summary could never be sent. · Logs showed a fabricated 1970-01-01 timestamp. · The stats page silently dropped entries; sections were clipped. · Every switch looked off. · Switching tabs made the whole panel disappear. · Plain-mode log order was inverted; the home page showed entries the log page did not. · Calendar streak was inflated; the "not signed today" state was unreachable. · Four classes of issues found in a full code read-through.

**Changed**: Full visual rework: from outlines everywhere to layering by surface tone. · Buttons now have four levels. · The light theme is warmer; light mode now uses solid colours instead of translucent overlays. · Settings: from stacked collapsible cards to an anchor bar plus one scrollable card. · The entry action menu now uses grouped cards with a single primary action. · Edit target: labels moved outside the fields; template chips now wrap. · Exclusion manager rebuilt as a four-step workflow. · Recent activity: fixed-width time column, icon slot, single-line truncation. · The stats page was rebuilt, drawn entirely on Canvas — no image assets. · Account overview redesigned. · The main panel was simplified.

**New**: Rule tester. · Turrit support. · External notifications (ntfy / Bark) and automatic backups. · The `/help` command opens the same guide as `/jmb`. · The guide was rewritten section by section and re-checked against the implementation. · The opening animation no longer loops forever, and the user can choose.
