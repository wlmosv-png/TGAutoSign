**Tap once. Signed every day.**

Tap the bot's check-in button in Telegram once — then never think about it again.
The control panel lives inside Telegram: send `/jmb` in any chat.

### Local by design

<sub>No account credentials, no official API, no data leaving your device.</sub>

- The **only outbound call** is an update check every 12 hours — it can be disabled, and it carries no sign-in data
- Targets and signed-state live in Telegram's local storage; they **never leave the device**
- The module requests **no** storage, notification or install permissions; all automation happens on-device, with no relay server

The fingerprint corresponds to the release key in use since September 2026; any key rotation will be announced in the release notes.

> ⚠️ **Risk notice** — any Telegram automation carries some risk of account restriction. This module uses client-side check-ins, randomised slots and backoff, and is deliberately gentle, but **makes no zero-risk claim**.

## What it does

- **Tap once, it learns** — tap the bot's check-in button once and it replays daily, automatically. It keeps up even when the button's callback data changes.
- **Text commands too** — set a bot ID plus a command (e.g. `/checkin`) and it sends on schedule.
- **Group & channel check-ins** — group IDs are supported; replies are read from group messages.
- **Your schedule** — signing window · per-target random slots · minimum spacing · make-up deadline (23:00 by default) · pause a target for a week.
- **Rate-limit friendly** — on failure it backs off 5m → 15m → 45m → 2h → 4h, waits out `FLOOD_WAIT` exactly as the server asks, and catches up when the network returns.
- **Block what you don't want** — keyword / regex rules (matched against bot replies and button labels) · block a whole bot · freeze a single target. Network-learned hits wait for your confirmation.
- **Multi-account, fully isolated** — targets and signed-state are kept per account; targets can be copied across accounts.
- **Daily summary** — one message a day to your own Saved Messages (no system notifications); an extra alert after 3 consecutive failing days.
- **Cross-client sync** — the official client and third-party clients share targets and signed state.
- **Bilingual UI** — English out of the box on English devices; switchable in Settings.
- **Local by design** — no server, no telemetry; the update check is the only outbound call and can be disabled.

## Supported clients

The module matches by host package first, then falls back to flag-class capability — it only injects on a match.

<sub>**Requires** root + LSPosed (libxposed **API 102** or newer — see LSPosed Manager → Settings → About). **Not supported**: non-root devices, Telegram X, standalone server deployment.</sub>

| Client | Package | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram (Play / default) | `org.telegram.messenger` | ✅ tested on 12.10.6 |
| Telegram (direct APK) | `org.telegram.messenger.web` | ✅ statically verified |
| Nagram (NextAlone) | `xyz.nextalone.nagram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3 |
| Nagram XF | `fork.risin42.nagramx` | ✅ tested (dec46b0) |
| ExteraLess (ExteraGram fork) | `com.exteraless.app` | ✅ tested on 12.10.1 |
| Mercurygram | `it.belloworld.mercurygram` | ✅ tested on 12.10.3.1 |
| Turrit | `org.telegram.group` | ✅ tested on 1.9.0.4.2 |
| Nagram / NagramX / NagramNX | `nu.gpu.nagram` etc. | whitelisted, not tested |
| Other Telegram-Android forks | any | injects if flag classes are intact |
| Telegram X | — | ❌ not injected (different core) |

Adapted for the whole Telegram **12.10.x** line, including 12.10.4.

> ⚠️ **Scope**: LSPosed only enables the official client by default. If you use a third-party client, tick **that client** in the module's scope as well.

---

## 30-second setup

1. Install the APK → **LSPosed** → **Modules** → enable **TGAutoSign**
2. Tick your Telegram client under **Scope**
3. Fully stop Telegram, then reopen it
4. Send `/jmb` in any chat → go to the bot chat and **tap its check-in button once**

> Done — it signs daily from then on. Send `/jmb` anytime to check status or change settings.

---

## FAQ

**Tapped the button but nothing was added**

Check the auto-learn switch under Settings → Learning, or add the target manually via `/jmb` → Add target. If it still won't add, make sure the scope is ticked and fully restart Telegram.

**The bot uses buttons instead of text — does that work?**

Yes. Tapping once teaches it (the list shows a type badge) and it replays daily. Buttons that merely open a web page or a game (no callback data) are never mis-learned.

**It works on the official client but not my third-party one**

Those clients are supported (see the matrix above), but scope only includes the official client by default. Tick your client in LSPosed, then fully restart Telegram.

**Signing isn't working — what do I do?**

Run `/jmb` → **Self-check** to verify the reflection anchors, then check the built-in log view for injection and signing records. Still stuck? Export the log together with your client name and version, and open an issue.

**How do I migrate to a new phone or account?**

On the old device: `/jmb` → **Export**. On the new one, drop the json into `Android/data/<client package>/files/tgautosign/` and import it. Import merges — it never wipes.

**Update says "signature mismatch"**

You installed a debug build. Uninstall it, then install the official APK from this page. Official builds upgrade over each other in place, and your data is kept.

## 更新日志 · Changelog

### v1.6.5 (131) — 2026-10-10

**Fixed**: Scheduled sign-in and missed-day make-up reset to off after restart. · The plain/detailed log toggle was not remembered. · Add and sign now could silently do nothing. · Can't find this chat: the last-resort lookup never worked. · Adding a second sign-in target to the same group overwrote the first. · The same group added twice with different id formats showed up as two targets. · With two targets in one group, replies could never be matched. · Switching to the log tab flickered. · The log box was half the height of the target list.

**New**: Group targets now show the group name. · Adding a target is now two steps. · New: sign-in statistics. · New: clear logs and clean up leftover state. · Target management is grouped by purpose. · Eight color themes, applied instantly. · Animations on a successful sign-in.

### v1.6.4 (130) — 2026-10-08

**Fixed**: A bot's "rules" or "stats" message could be mistaken for a successful check-in. · In groups, the bot could reply and the module still reported "no reply". · Someone else checking in could be credited to you. · A group id missing the "100" prefix could never be matched. · Your own command could show up in the "unrecognised replies" list. · One entry in the pending list could keep growing. · A filtered button used to vanish with no way back. · Mentioning "check-in" while chatting could be collected. · Opening the log page flickered. · The last row could be cut off in the target list and stats. · The review page stuttered on every tap. · The pending badge said 1 while several items were waiting. · The Turrit client was installed but the module never took effect. · Negated phrasings could be misjudged. · The in-app updater got safer.

**New**: The review page got a full redesign. · You can now teach it replies it can't read. · Tapping a button no longer learns everything. · Confirming a candidate can also remember what to do next time. · Sign-in-like buttons are learned automatically; the rest are asked about.
